YSRec is a portable program for an easiest way to download YouTube streams. Just put the link and click the button, that's all!


<h2 align="center"><b>Screenshot and how it works</b></h2>

<p align="center"><a href=""><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testertv/YSRec.github.io/main/Screenshots/screenshot.jpg"></a></p>



- (1) Open path/download folder

- (2) Field for download path and download link, case-specific. Double-clicking in this field deletes the complete content in it.

- (3) Paste stream link from clipboard to textfield

- (4) Choose the quality of the stream. These are fixed values, so the user should choose the quality himself!

- (5) Start / Stop the stream download
---------------------------------------------------
- (6) This is a beta function of an automatic download at a selected time. All  you have to do is enter the start and end time in format [hh:mm] ( do not click any buttons!!!). 

To reset the time field, simply double-click on the "Start" or "Enter" label.

However, this function only works if your PC does not log off automaticly and no screen saver is turned on! To be able to use this function without restrictions, it is necessary to know the Windows API, which I unfortunately do not do at the moment.

The program is portable, but you need to put the following files (yt-dlp.exe, ffmpeg.exe) in the YSRec folder. Github has problems with publishing "yt-dlp" and co., so you will have to download and put "yt-dlp" and "ffmpeg" in the folder yourself. 
  
  If you have received an error message immediately after starting the program for the first time, please download the latest version of program that is compatible (x32/x64) with your Windows.
